# Game of Thrones Game (GOTG)
A 'choose your own adventure' game running in the Bash command line written in Ruby.

![](https://github.com/chrisstaudinger/GOT-game/blob/master/assets/images/gotg-intro.gif?raw=true "GOGT Intro GIF")

# Purpose

* GOTG was created as a side project on top of the fundamentals of coding I was learning at the time at Coder Academy's intensive bootcamp.
* The game was built in order to practice and solidify my fundamental coding skills, whilst pin pointing and closing gaps in my knowledge. 

# Installation To Run Game

* Clone or download repository.

* Bundler allows all the dependencies to be installed with one command. (If you don't have Bundler installed, follow this step).

``` Ruby
$ gem install bundler
```

* This command installs of the dependencies
``` Ruby
$ bundle install
```

* Run The Game
``` Ruby
$ ruby main.rb
```
****

# Dependencies 

* gem 'tty-prompt'
* gem 'colorize'
* gem 'artii'
* gem 'tty-font'
* gem 'paint'

# Future Enhancements

Arya Stark's & Jon Snow's storylines have not been completed yet. I will be coming back to complete those storylines. However, I imagine by the time I come back to it I will find that the code and architechure of the game could be much better and either refactor or just rebuild the game. 

# Tools Used
* Trello - Kanban Board (**Project Management**)
* Gems

# Ruby Code Used
* Classes & objects - class methods and instance methods 
* File methods
* Modules
* Ruby core library
